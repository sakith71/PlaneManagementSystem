# Plane Management System

## Project Description


The Plane Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application developed to streamline the management of airline operations. This system facilitates the handling of planes, passengers, and tickets, providing a robust solution for airline companies to manage their day-to-day operations efficiently. The application demonstrates a strong use of object-oriented programming principles and serves as a foundational system that can be expanded with additional features.

## Main Features

- **Plane Management**: 
  - Add, update, and delete plane records.
  - Store essential details like plane ID, model, and capacity.

- **Passenger Management**: 
  - Maintain a database of passengers.
  - Associate passengers with specific flights.
  - Handle passenger-specific details such as personal information and travel history.

- **Ticket Management**: 
  - Issue and manage tickets for passengers.
  - Track ticket status, including issued, checked-in, and cancelled tickets.
  - Link tickets with corresponding flights and passengers.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following main components:

- **PlaneManagementSystem.java**: The core class responsible for managing planes and associated operations.
- **Person.java**: Represents a person, likely a passenger, in the system.
- **Ticket.java**: Manages ticket-related operations.

The Plane Management System offers a solid foundation for managing key aspects of airline operations. It is designed to be both scalable and user-friendly, making it a suitable choice for small to medium-sized airlines looking to automate their operations. With its modular design, the system can easily be expanded to include additional features, such as flight scheduling, crew management, and real-time ticket booking.

This project not only showcases fundamental Java programming skills but also serves as a stepping stone for more complex systems in the future. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface, database integration, and real-time data processing capabilities.
